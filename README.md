# A BASIC Interpreter in Go
This is a simple BASIC interpreter implement in Go. It's not intended for anything resembling real use.
It's not intended to implement most/all of any BASIC dialect. It's not intended to be the best/fastest/optimal 
implementation. It's just a little sandbox.

## Why?
Way back when, I implemented a BASIC interpreter in Perl as a way to learn Perl. So, this is a bit of a learning kata.
As such, this isn't the first time I've implemented this - I did it a while ago, and it got lost when I lost access
to the computer I implemented it on. Most recently, I'm using it to play around with Visual Code.
